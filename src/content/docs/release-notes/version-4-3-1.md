## 1. Core library

* `FullTextSearch` extension method - now you can easily set up a [full-text search functionality](/https://youtu.be/0XQT6x0Ge08) in your app
* `ODataQueryBuilder` class - allows to build OData queries
* `ToSql` extension method for LINQ expressions - now you can easily get an SQL statement for your LINQ query generated by our components.
* Support for TimeZoneOffset during query generation
* Few improvements in `FillByDbGate` methods
* Add table's schema during model loading from DbContext 

## 2. JavaScript
 
* `onError` event is now called on every error during AJAX calls from the EasyQuery widgets to the server-side. You can setup your own handler for that event to overwrite its default behavior (showing an alert). 
* `listCache` option - now you can set up an external cache for the lists used in different values editors.
* Few additional functions in EQ.core.Query object: `setName`, `setModelId`, `removeColumnAt`
* `loadModelOnStart` option in `easyQuerySettings`
* Chart providers: now you can attach different chart libraries to draw charts for the data returned by EasyQuery. Two libraries are supported for now: Google Charts and Chart.js

* A lot of small improvements

## 3. Oracle connector in DME

Now you can fill your data model right from Oracle database using our OracleDbGate class
